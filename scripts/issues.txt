title: Set up CI
body: |
  We need GitHub Actions to run tests on every pull request.
  This should cover:
    - Install dependencies
    - Run eslint
    - Run unit tests
---
title: Create CONTRIBUTING.md
body: |
  Document coding standards, branch strategy, and review process so contributors know what to expect.
---
title: Add Dockerfile
body: |
  Ship the app in a container for consistent local and production environments.
  Ensure the image is as small as possible by using multi-stage builds.
