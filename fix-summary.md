# Fix Summary: tsconfig-paths/register Module Not Found Error

## Issue
The development server was failing to start with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'tsconfig-paths/register'
```

## Root Cause
The project dependencies were not installed. The `node_modules` directory was missing, which meant that none of the npm packages (including `tsconfig-paths`) were available.

## Solution
1. **Installed dependencies**: Ran `npm install` to install all packages listed in `package.json`
2. **Verified installation**: Confirmed that `tsconfig-paths` module was installed correctly in `node_modules/tsconfig-paths/`
3. **Tested the module**: Created and ran a test script to verify that `tsconfig-paths/register` could be loaded successfully

## Result
After installing the dependencies, the `tsconfig-paths/register` module is now available and the development server can start without the module not found error.

## Next Steps
The development server should now run successfully with `npm run dev`. The server will:
- Use nodemon to watch for file changes
- Use ts-node with tsconfig-paths/register to handle TypeScript compilation and path mappings
- Automatically restart when source files are modified
